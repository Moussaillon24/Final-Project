	<h2>Celebrity speakers help Celtics stay connected during shutdown</h2>
	<p>In an attempt to stay connected during the NBA shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, Boston Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said the team has had an assortment of guest speakers talk to its players over the past few weeks.<br>

	"We've had Mark Wahlberg, who was great," Ainge said on a conference call with reporters Wednesday. "He was a lot of fun, had some really good stories. LL Cool J, his story is pretty fascinating. [Celtics minority owner] Jim Cash, who is always magnificent to listen to, had some great wisdom and knowledge for the players. And we had Dr. Myron Rolle, who has a fascinating story here at Mass General. So yeah, we've had some very inspirational speakers."</p>
	<p>That's just one of the ways Ainge and Celtics coach Brad Stevens are trying to stay connected with their players as this shutdown moves well into its second month and with no signs of play resuming anytime soon.
	Ainge said the Celtics are approaching the break with the mindset that they will return to play at some point. As a team with hopes of a deep playoff run, there is a heightened need to make sure players stay engaged.<br>
	"This is a time for the really self-motivated that are going to be able to take advantage of this opportunity in their career to get stronger, to get in greater condition," Ainge said. "We're approaching this like we're going to return to play and we're going to be playing playoff basketball. So we are staying in touch, we are having conference calls where we have guest speakers, motivational speakers who address all of our guys on Zoom. We are doing workouts with the coaches and with the strength coaches via Zoom and so forth. So we're trying to do all we can."</p>
